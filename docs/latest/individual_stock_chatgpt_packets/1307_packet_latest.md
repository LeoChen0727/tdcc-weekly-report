## Data Quality Rules
- This packet is generated from repo raw CSV files so ChatGPT does not need to expand large CSV files first.
- Use this packet first for single-stock analysis. Use raw/pages/API URLs only when deeper inspection is needed.
- For chart or K-line work, always read `price_window_180_html_pages_url` or `price_window_180_txt_*` first. The 20-row preview is not enough for technical analysis.
- Single-stock chart and main conclusion should use 23EMA as the primary moving-average observation line.
- MA20 / MA60 / MA120 remain backend auxiliary and backtest fields; do not make them the main chart/conclusion unless the user explicitly asks.
- The full historical CSV remains available for Python backtests.
- If price_rows < 60, do not produce a standard technical report.
- If tdcc_rows < 8, mark insufficient_tdcc_history and do not make 8-12 week TDCC backtest conclusions.
- External news can supplement events, but must not replace repo price history or repo TDCC history as primary data.

## ACTION_DECISION
- action_rating: scale_in
- action_rating_label_zh: 可分批買進
- confidence_level: medium
- thesis_state: healthy_pullback
- entry_style: pullback_to_23ema
- position_sizing: half_position

### management_plan
- buy_first_tranche_near_support
- add_on_23ema_hold
- add_on_reclaim_23ema
- add_on_breakout
- take_profit_near_prior_high
- take_profit_on_volume_price_failure
- exit_if_lost_23ema
- exit_if_lost_recent_low
- exit_if_revenue_breaks
- exit_if_tdcc_and_price_both_weaken

### entry_prerequisites
- model_recommended
- decision_priority_high
- decision_score_high
- price_structure_not_broken
- near_23ema_or_support
- revenue_not_deteriorating
- no_major_tdcc_warning
- no_major_volume_price_failure
- acceptable_risk_reward

### post_entry_watch_items
- next_monthly_revenue
- next_tdcc_update
- 23ema_hold_or_reclaim
- volume_price_confirmation
- prior_high_breakout_quality
- sector_benchmark_strength
- event_follow_through
- warrant_overheat_check

### downgrade_reason
- insufficient_tdcc_history

### chatgpt_instruction
- Open the report with action_rating_label_zh as the program-side action conclusion.
- Do not downgrade buy_now / scale_in / starter_position to wait_pullback unless current repo price, volume, or TDCC data contradicts ACTION_DECISION.
- Treat post_entry_watch_items as post-entry monitoring, not as buy-before requirements.

## Interpretation Guardrails
- ACTION_DECISION is the program-side action guidance for single-stock trading language.
- If action_rating is buy_now / scale_in / starter_position, do not rewrite it as waiting for confirmation unless current repo price, TDCC, or volume data directly contradicts it.
- entry_prerequisites are first-tranche requirements. post_entry_watch_items are post-entry monitoring checks, not buy-before blockers.
- For K-line or technical conclusions, use PRICE_WINDOW data first; do not rely on external price websites unless repo price data is unavailable.
- For TDCC conclusions, use TDCC_WINDOW data first; if tdcc_history_status=insufficient_tdcc_history, only make short-term observations.
- Candidate Context shows whether the stock entered the daily model; absence from candidates does not mean price/TDCC raw data is unavailable.
- Warrant signals are auxiliary only and must not be used as a standalone reason.
