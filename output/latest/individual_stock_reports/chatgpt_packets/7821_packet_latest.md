## Data Quality Rules
- This packet is generated from repo raw CSV files so ChatGPT does not need to expand large CSV files first.
- Use this packet first for single-stock analysis. Use raw/pages/API URLs only when deeper inspection is needed.
- For chart or K-line work, always read `price_window_180_html_pages_url` or `price_window_180_txt_*` first. The 20-row preview is not enough for technical analysis.
- Single-stock chart and main conclusion should use 23EMA as the primary moving-average observation line.
- MA20 / MA60 / MA120 remain backend auxiliary and backtest fields; do not make them the main chart/conclusion unless the user explicitly asks.
- The full historical CSV remains available for Python backtests.
- If price_rows < 60, do not produce a standard technical report.
- Only claim tdcc_history_ready when the canonical dataset_id matches, every required official date is present, tdcc_rows >= 8, and latest_tdcc_date equals official_tdcc_signal_date.
- If latest_tdcc_date differs from official_tdcc_signal_date, mark tdcc_window_stale and do not claim current TDCC history.
- A canonical accepted stock-level missing date must be disclosed as tdcc_history_degraded_exception; it must not be treated as a continuous weekly series.
- If the stock is absent from the official current main-price universe, preserve real TDCC dates and mark historical_only_noncurrent; do not infer a formal delisting status.
- If TDCC is current but tdcc_rows < 8, mark insufficient_tdcc_history and do not make 8-12 week TDCC backtest conclusions.
- External news can supplement events, but must not replace repo price history or repo TDCC history as primary data.

## Interpretation Guardrails
- ACTION_DISPLAY is the PDF-visible report language contract.
- ACTION_DECISION is internal model context only; do not print its raw field names or raw values in investor-facing prose.
- Use entry_strategy_zh, position_sizing_zh, add_position_strategy_zh, take_profit_strategy_zh, risk_control_zh, and post_entry_watch_zh for report text.
- For K-line or technical conclusions, use PRICE_WINDOW data first; do not rely on external price websites unless repo price data is unavailable.
- For TDCC conclusions, use TDCC_WINDOW data first; if tdcc_history_status=insufficient_tdcc_history, only make short-term observations.
- Candidate Context shows whether the stock entered the daily model; absence from candidates does not mean price/TDCC raw data is unavailable.
- Warrant signals are auxiliary only and must not be used as a standalone reason.
