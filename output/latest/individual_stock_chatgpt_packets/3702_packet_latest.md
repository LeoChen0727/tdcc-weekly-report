## Data Quality Rules
- This packet is generated from repo raw CSV files so ChatGPT does not need to expand large CSV files first.
- Use this packet first for single-stock analysis. Use raw/pages/API URLs only when deeper inspection is needed.
- For chart or K-line work, always read `price_window_180_html_pages_url` or `price_window_180_txt_*` first. The 20-row preview is not enough for technical analysis.
- Single-stock chart and main conclusion should use 23EMA as the primary moving-average observation line.
- MA20 / MA60 / MA120 remain backend auxiliary and backtest fields; do not make them the main chart/conclusion unless the user explicitly asks.
- The full historical CSV remains available for Python backtests.
- If price_rows < 60, do not produce a standard technical report.
- If tdcc_rows < 8, mark insufficient_tdcc_history and do not make 8-12 week TDCC backtest conclusions.
- External news can supplement events, but must not replace repo price history or repo TDCC history as primary data.

## Interpretation Guardrails
- This packet supports analysis; it is not a buy/sell recommendation by itself.
- For K-line or technical conclusions, use PRICE_WINDOW data first; do not rely on external price websites unless repo price data is unavailable.
- For TDCC conclusions, use TDCC_WINDOW data first; if tdcc_history_status=insufficient_tdcc_history, only make short-term observations.
- Candidate Context shows whether the stock entered the daily model; absence from candidates does not mean price/TDCC raw data is unavailable.
- Warrant signals are auxiliary only and must not be used as a standalone reason.
