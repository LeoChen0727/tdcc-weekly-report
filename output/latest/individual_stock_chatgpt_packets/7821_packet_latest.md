## Data Quality Rules
- This packet is generated from repo raw CSV files so ChatGPT does not need to expand large CSV files first.
- Use this packet first for single-stock analysis. Use raw/pages/API URLs only when deeper inspection is needed.
- For chart or K-line work, always read `price_window_180_html_pages_url` or `price_window_180_txt_*` first. The 20-row preview is not enough for technical analysis.
- Single-stock chart and main conclusion should use 23EMA as the primary moving-average observation line.
- MA20 / MA60 / MA120 remain backend auxiliary and backtest fields; do not make them the main chart/conclusion unless the user explicitly asks.
- The full historical CSV remains available for Python backtests.
- If price_rows < 60, do not produce a standard technical report.
- If tdcc_rows < 8, mark insufficient_tdcc_history and do not make 8-12 week TDCC backtest conclusions.
- External news can supplement events, but must not replace repo price history or repo TDCC history as primary data.

## ACTION_DISPLAY
- pdf_visible: true
- action_rating_display_zh: 已持有續抱
- model_category_display_zh: 單一個股分析
- score_interpretation_zh: 目前缺少完整分數資料，需以價格、TDCC 與風險條件輔助判斷。 目前以既有部位管理與條件追蹤為主。
- action_summary_zh: 單一個股分析 目前屬於「訊號不明」，以既有部位管理與條件追蹤為主。
- entry_strategy_zh: 已持有以續抱管理為主；新買需等待重新出現進場條件。
- position_sizing_zh: 僅觀察；部位大小需依支撐距離、波動與模型確認度控制。
- add_position_strategy_zh: 接近前高或壓力區可分批停利、量價失敗或爆量不漲時降低部位、跌破 23EMA 且 1 至 3 日內無法收回時退出、跌破近期低點時退出、營收或財報明顯轉弱時降低部位、TDCC 與價格同步轉弱時退出
- take_profit_strategy_zh: 接近前高或壓力區可分批停利；若爆量不漲、長上影或量價背離，需降低部位。
- risk_control_zh: TDCC 歷史不足
- post_entry_watch_zh: 下一次月營收、下一次 TDCC 更新、23EMA 是否守住或快速站回、量價是否延續確認、前高突破品質、族群與 benchmark 強弱、事件催化是否延續、權證是否過熱
- final_decision_zh: 單一個股分析 目前屬於「訊號不明」，以既有部位管理與條件追蹤為主。 進場策略：已持有以續抱管理為主；新買需等待重新出現進場條件。 追蹤項目：下一次月營收、下一次 TDCC 更新、23EMA 是否守住或快速站回、量價是否延續確認、前高突破品質、族群與 benchmark 強弱、事件催化是否延續、權證是否過熱 風控：TDCC 歷史不足

## Interpretation Guardrails
- ACTION_DISPLAY is the PDF-visible report language contract.
- ACTION_DECISION is internal model context only; do not print its raw field names or raw values in investor-facing prose.
- Use entry_strategy_zh, position_sizing_zh, add_position_strategy_zh, take_profit_strategy_zh, risk_control_zh, and post_entry_watch_zh for report text.
- For K-line or technical conclusions, use PRICE_WINDOW data first; do not rely on external price websites unless repo price data is unavailable.
- For TDCC conclusions, use TDCC_WINDOW data first; if tdcc_history_status=insufficient_tdcc_history, only make short-term observations.
- Candidate Context shows whether the stock entered the daily model; absence from candidates does not mean price/TDCC raw data is unavailable.
- Warrant signals are auxiliary only and must not be used as a standalone reason.
