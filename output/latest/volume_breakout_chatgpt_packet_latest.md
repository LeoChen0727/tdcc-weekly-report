## Why Strict Breakout May Look Empty

- `breakout_latest.csv` only reflects strict 60-day volume-confirmed breakout logic.
- Many volume attacks are routed to `range_rebound` or `pattern_watch` when they are near a neckline/platform but not a strict 60-day breakout.
- Broad recall rows are intentionally listed to reduce missed W-bottom/right-side/platform setups; they must be ranked by score and risk context before interpretation.
- ChatGPT should read this packet when the user asks about 帶量突破 / 放量突破 / 放量攻擊.

## Rules

- This layer is for visibility and performance tracking, not standalone buy advice.
- Broad recall rows are allowed to be noisy. Treat them as a second-layer universe, not as strict breakouts.
- Use `volume_breakout_priority` to separate valid watch, confirmation-needed, watch-only, and risk-downgrade names.
- Do not call a stock strict breakout unless `volume_breakout_type=strict_60d_volume_breakout` or original `category=true_breakout`.
- If `selection_status=selected_but_routed_to_other_category`, explain the route instead of saying the model missed it.
- If `selection_status=not_selected_by_candidate_model`, list the price-derived signal and its `not_selected_reason`.
- TDCC distribution, stale repeat appearance, long upper shadows, and overheating should downgrade the interpretation.
